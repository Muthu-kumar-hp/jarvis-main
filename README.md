Jarvis AI – Personal Voice Assistant

Jarvis AI is a voice-controlled personal assistant built using Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It combines speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and a user-friendly web interface to perform tasks like answering questions, opening apps, searching the web, and more – similar to Iron Man’s Jarvis!

🚀 Features

🎤 Voice Commands – Interact with Jarvis using natural speech

🧠 AI-powered Responses – Uses NLP to understand and respond intelligently

🌐 Web Interface – Clean and responsive UI (HTML, CSS, JS)

🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS) – Jarvis speaks responses back to you

⚡ Task Automation – Open apps, search Google, play music, fetch weather, etc.

🔐 Offline + Online Modes – Works with local models and APIs

🎨 Animated UI – Modern, futuristic design inspired by Jarvis
